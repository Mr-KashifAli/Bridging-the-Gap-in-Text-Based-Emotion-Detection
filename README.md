# 📚 Bridging the Gap in Text-Based Emotion Detection
## 📖 Overview
This project aims to develop a system for detecting perceived emotions in text using deep learning algorithms. The task encompasses multiple dimensions, including emotion classification, intensity estimation, and cross-lingual emotion detection. By addressing the complexity and nuances of emotional expression in text, we can enhance our understanding of human communication.

## 🛠️ Project Goals
* Multi-label Emotion Detection: Identify emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust in given text snippets.
* Emotion Intensity Prediction: Estimate the intensity of detected emotions.
* Cross-lingual Emotion Detection: Apply insights from one language to predict emotions in another language.
## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data Collection: Utilize a diverse dataset with labeled text snippets across various languages, ensuring coverage of under-resourced regions.

2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data to prepare it for model training, including tokenization, normalization, and encoding.

3. Deep Learning Models:

* Implement multiple deep learning algorithms (e.g., LSTM, CNN, BERT) to evaluate their performance on the emotion detection tasks.
* Fine-tune hyperparameters and model architectures to optimize accuracy.
4. Model Evaluation:

* Compare the accuracy of different models using appropriate metrics (e.g., F1-score, precision, recall).
* Select the best-performing model for deployment.
## 🚀 Future Plans
In the future, I plan to deploy this emotion detection system using Streamlit, enabling users to input text and receive real-time emotion analysis. This interactive application will demonstrate the capabilities of the model in a user-friendly format.

## 📦 Libraries and Tools
* Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
* Natural Language Processing: NLTK, SpaCy, Transformers
* Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Deployment: Streamlit
